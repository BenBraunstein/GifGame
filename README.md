## Motivation

Everyone loves a good gif, but have you ever played a multiple choice game where you try and pick specific gifts? Thats exactly why we made one.

We built an application which automatically generates questions for our four game modes:

1. The Synonym Game - Try and guess the search term that found this Gif
2. The Dog Breed Game - Try and guess the dog breed in this Gif
3. The Movie Game - Try and Guess the movie this Gif comes from
4. The Matching Game - Given a searched term and 4 Gifs. Try and guess the least popular Gif for from this search term

## Build Status

Giffy Guesser is likely in its final state, besides for some new questions to be added.

## Code Style

Indentation.

## Frameworks

This app is created with the Rails MVC Framework and uses the Tenor API to find Gifs.

## Installation

Clone down then start it with the command `rails s` open localhost to port and enjoy!

## How to use

Sign up or log in to an existing account. Click "Choose a Game", then pick the type of game you want to play. You can also challenege another user who has recently played and play the exact same game as they did to try and beat their score and get your name to the top of the leaderboards for that game. In your profile you can see your completed games as well as your overall statistics in all game types.
